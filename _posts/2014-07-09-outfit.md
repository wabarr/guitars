    C                       G
You wanna grow up to paint houses like me
        D                       C
With a trailer in my yard 'til you're twenty-three
    C                     G
You wanna feel old after forty-two years
      D                       C
Keep droppin' the hammer and grindin' the gears

        D                   C
Well, I used to go out in a Mustang
    D           C
A three-o-two Mach one in green
  D                   C
Me and your mama made you in the back
      D                     C
And I sold it to buy her a ring

    C                         G
I learned not to say much of nothin'
          C                 G
So I'll figure you already know
      C                     Em
But in case you don't, or maybe you forgot
      D                         C
I'll lay it out real nice and slow

      C                           G
Don't call what you're wearin' an outfit
      C                     G
Don't ever say your car is broke
      C                       Em
Don't worry 'bout losin' your accent
    D                         C
A southern man tells better jokes

      C                         G
Have fun and stay clear of the needle
      C                       G
Call home on your sister's birthday
        C                          Em
Don't tell'em you're bigger than Jesus
                Am G Em
Don't give it away
                Am G Em
Don't give it away

        D                       C
Five years in a Saint Florian foundry
      D                   C
They call it Industrial Park
      D                         C
Then hospital maintenance and tech school
              D                 C
So I could memorize Frigidare parts

    C                       G
But I got to missin' your mama
    C                       G
And I got to missin' you, too
    C                       Em
I went back to paintin' for my old man
    D                             C
And I guess that's what I'll always do

    C                           G
So don't let'em take who you are, boy
    C                         G
And don't try to be who you ain't
    C                         Em
And don't let me catch you in Kendale
        D                       C
With a bucket of wealthy-man's paint

      C                           G
Don't call what you're wearin' an outfit
      C                     G
Don't ever say your car is broke
      C                         Em
Don't sing with a fake British accent
      D                          C
Don't act like your family's a joke

      C                          G
Have fun and stay clear of the needle
      C                           G
Call home on your sister's birthday
      C                           Em
Don't tell'em you're bigger than Jesus
                Am G Em
Don't give it away
                Am G Em
Don't give it away
