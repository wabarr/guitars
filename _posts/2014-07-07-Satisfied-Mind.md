D     	 G    A         A            D     D
How many times have you heard someone say
      D        A        A           G            D      D
If I had his money...           I'd do things my way
       D          A      A                  G           D      D
But little they know...           that it's so hard to find
       D         A       A     	           G       D     D     D
One rich man in ten...           with a satisfied mind

    	     	G   A          A         D      D
Once I was winning in fortune and fame;
      D             A        A                G               D       D     D
Everything that I dreamed for,       to get a start in lifes game.
    D            A      A      G              D     D
But suddenly it happened,    I lost every dime,
          D         A     A                 G            D     D     D
But I'm richer by far               with a satisfied mind.

D     		    G    A      A                   D         D
Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
      D             		 A    A               G                  D       D
Or a friend when you're lonely           or a love that's grown cold;
    D            A       A            G             D       D
The wealthiest person            is a pauper at times
  D               A      A                G          D    D    D
Compared to the man,             with a satisfied mind.

    D            A       A       G             D       D
When life has ended,         my time has run out,
    D                A       A                 G                  D       D     D
My friends and my loved ones            I'll leave, there's no doubt.
    D		             G    A       A             D         D
But one thing's for certain, when it comes my time,
      D                 A     A                G         D       D
I'll leave this old world              with a satisfied mind.

(Repeat Verse 1)
